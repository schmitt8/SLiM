# Melanic allele simulations

I used SLiM to simulate the melanic allele under 3 stepping stone scenarios. Note that these are not fully spatially explicit, but they are quasi spatial by limiting migration in certain directions. SLiM can do fully spatially explicit simulations, but I figured I would try these simpler models first. The three scenarios are:
* stable population size - 20000 total individuals spread across three linear stepping stone 'fingers' (Chillon, Rimac, and Lurin valleys) connected at the coast.
